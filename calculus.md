### Derivatives

A derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of a function.

A derivative equal of 0 means zero rate of change.

Lagrange's notation for the derivative is as follows:

given a function $y = f(x)$, the derivative can be either expressed as:

- Lagrange's notation:  $f'(x)$   
- Leibniz's notation:  $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}f(x)$ 

#### Common derivatives:

##### derivative of a constant:
  
$$
f(x) = k  \\
f'(x) = 0
$$

##### derivative of a line:
$$
f(x) = ax + b \\
f'(x) = a
$$

##### derivative of quadratic functions:

$$
f(x) = x^2 \\
f'(x) = 2x
$$

##### derivatives of power functions in general:

$$
f(x) = x^n \\
f'(x) = n x^{n-1} 
$$

It also works for negative $n$: 

given $f(x)= \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$, 

then  $f'(x) = (-1)x^{-2} = - \frac{1}{x^2}$

##### inverse function and its derivative:

The inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ is a function that undoes what the original function does, so that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.

If $g$ is the inverse of $f$, the derivative of the inverse function follows the following formula:

$$
g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(x)}
$$

#### derivatives for trigonometric functions:
$$
f(x) = \sin(x) \\
f'(x) = \cos(x)
$$

$$
f(x) = \cos(x) \\
f'(x) = -\sin(x)
$$

$$
f(x) = \tan(x) \\
f'(x) = \sec^2(x)
$$
